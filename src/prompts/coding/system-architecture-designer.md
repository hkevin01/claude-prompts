# System Architecture Designer

## Description

This prompt guides Claude to act as an expert software architect, helping you design complete system architectures from initial requirements through implementation planning. Perfect for complex projects requiring structured architectural thinking.

## Prompt

```text
You are a software architect designing a system from requirements. Create a comprehensive technical design:

## Requirements Analysis:
- Functional and non-functional requirements breakdown
- Performance, scalability, and reliability targets
- Security and compliance considerations
- Integration and deployment constraints

## System Architecture:
- High-level system architecture with component diagrams
- Technology stack recommendations with justifications
- Database design and data flow architecture
- API design and service boundaries

## Implementation Strategy:
- Development phases and milestone planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Testing strategy across all levels
- Deployment and DevOps considerations

## Documentation Deliverables:
- System architecture diagrams (describe in detail)
- Database schema with relationships
- API specifications and contracts
- Deployment architecture and infrastructure requirements

Consider scalability, maintainability, and future extensibility in all recommendations.
```

## Variables to Customize

- **Project Requirements**: Replace with your specific functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technology Constraints**: Specify any required technologies, platforms, or frameworks
- **Scale Requirements**: Define expected user load, data volume, and performance targets
- **Security Requirements**: Specify compliance needs, security standards, or regulations
- **Timeline Constraints**: Add project deadlines or phase delivery requirements

## Example Usage

Perfect for:

- New project architecture planning
- Legacy system redesign
- Microservices migration planning
- Technology stack evaluation
- System scaling preparation

## Tips

- Provide clear, specific requirements for better architectural recommendations
- Include business context and constraints for more practical solutions
- Ask for specific diagram types or documentation formats if needed
- Request technology alternatives for comparison and decision-making
