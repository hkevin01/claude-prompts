General Instructions 

Work Iteratively by Phases: 

Focus on completing all tasks within the current phase before moving to the next phase. 

Revisit completed phases periodically to refine or enhance features based on feedback or new requirements. 

Create, Organize, and Update Files: 

Follow the project structure and ensure all necessary files and folders are created with appropriate content. 

Regularly update key files, including project_plan.md and test_plan.md, to reflect progress, changes, and future improvements. 

Write Modular and Maintainable Code: 

Ensure all code is clean, reusable, and well-documented, adhering to best practices. 

Refactor existing code as needed to improve efficiency, readability, and maintainability. 

Implement Features and Improvements: 

For each task, write the required functionality while integrating it seamlessly with the rest of the project. 

Continuously implement suggested features and improvements, whether they come from internal reviews, user feedback, or testing results. 

Test, Validate, and Improve: 

Test the implementation of each phase to ensure it functions correctly and meets the requirements. 

Use test results to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary fixes or enhancements. 

Document Progress and Changes: 

Maintain clear documentation for all phases, including code comments, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips. 

Regularly update the project_plan.md and test_plan.md files to reflect completed tasks, new features, and planned improvements. 

Incorporate Feedback and Reviews: 

Actively seek feedback from stakeholders, users, or collaborators and incorporate their suggestions into the project roadmap. 

 

 

Phase Execution 

For each phase: 

Understand the Tasks and Goals: 

Carefully review the tasks and deliverables for the current phase. 

Identify opportunities for improvement or feature extensions before starting implementation. 

Plan, Execute, and Enhance: 

Break down tasks into smaller sub-tasks where necessary and implement them systematically. 

Continuously evaluate the functionality being developed and incorporate enhancements where applicable. 

Create and Update Configurations (if applicable): 

Implement or revise configuration files and parameters to allow flexibility and customization. 

Handle Errors Proactively: 

Add or improve error handling to ensure the system remains robust and resilient. 

Test, Validate, and Iterate: 

Run tests for individual components and the entire phase to validate functionality. 

Use test results to refine the implementation, ensuring high reliability and performance. 

Prepare and Enhance Documentation: 

Add or update documentation for the phase, including setup instructions, usage examples, troubleshooting steps, and notes on improvements. 

 

 

Final Phase Instructions 

Review, Refine, and Finalize: 

Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire project to ensure all phases are complete, cohesive, and meet project goals. 

Refine existing features or components based on feedback, testing results, or new insights. 

Prepare for Release: 

Package all deliverables for release, including final documentation, versioning, and changelog updates. 

Ensure project_plan.md and test_plan.md are up-to-date and fully reflect the release version. 

Test End-to-End: 

Verify that the entire workflow operates as expected across different environments or use cases. 

Engage and Iterate: 

Provide stakeholders and users with methods to give feedback (e.g., issue tracking, discussions). 

Use this feedback to plan and prioritize future improvements and updates. 

Plan for Maintenance and Continuous Improvement: 

Establish a process for ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and updates. 

Schedule periodic reviews of both the project_plan.md and test_plan.md to ensure they stay relevant and actionable. 

 

 

Deliverables 

At all times, you should provide: 

A functional implementation of the project, organized and continuously improved. 

Updated versions of all key project files, including:  

project_plan.md (reflecting progress, new features, and planned tasks). 

test_plan.md (detailing testing progress, coverage, and results). 

Test results and validation for all phases, with iterative improvements based on findings. 

Clear and comprehensive documentation, including usage instructions, troubleshooting, and release notes. 

A plan or process for future maintenance, feature additions, and updates. 

 

 

Continuous Improvement Guidelines 

Update .gitignore: 

Ensure the .gitignore file is updated whenever new files or directories are added to the project. 

Incorporate New Features: 

Continuously evaluate and implement features that enhance functionality, usability, or performance. 

Regularly Refactor: 

Periodically revisit the codebase to improve structure, efficiency, and maintainability. 

Expand Test Coverage: 

Add tests for new features, edge cases, and previously untested areas as the project evolves. 

Document All Changes: 

Log all updates, enhancements, and fixes in the appropriate sections of project_plan.md and test_plan.md. 

By following this approach, the project will remain dynamic, adaptable, and aligned with evolving requirements.
