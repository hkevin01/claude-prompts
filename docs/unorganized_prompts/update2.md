# Project Plan Execution Prompt 

  

## Workflow: 

1. **Phase Execution**: 

   - Review tasks for the phase and break them into sub-tasks. 

   - Implement features, create files, and add configurations as needed. 

   - Write modular, reusable, and well-documented code. 

   - Add robust error handling for reliability. 

   - Test individual components and the entire phase for correctness. 

  

2. **Documentation**: 

   - Document setup, usage, and troubleshooting for each phase. 

   - Update `.gitignore` as needed. 

  

3. **Final Phase**: 

   - Review and test the entire project end-to-end. 

   - Package deliverables, including documentation and versioning. 

   - Plan for future maintenance and updates. 

  

## Deliverables: 

- Fully functional project, organized by phases. 

- Code, configuration files, test results, and documentation. 

- Clear instructions for usage, troubleshooting, and maintenance. 

  

**Focus:** Stay phase-specific, validate each step, and ensure clean, modular code.
