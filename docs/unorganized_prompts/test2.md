General Instructions 

Set Up Test Infrastructure:  

Create the necessary testing environment, including tools, frameworks, and configurations for automated testing. 

Organize Tests by Phases:  

Implement tests according to the phased roadmap, ensuring all tasks in a phase are completed before moving to the next. 

Write and Execute Tests:  

Create modular, reusable, and well-documented test cases for each task. 

Simulate Real-World Scenarios:  

Test edge cases, errors, and performance bottlenecks to ensure robustness. 

Automate Testing:  

Ensure all tests can be executed via a single command and are integrated with a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. 

Document Results:  

Maintain a record of test results, including coverage summaries, critical failures, regressions, and manual test outcomes. 

 

 

Phased Testing Roadmap 

For each phase: 

Understand the Objectives:  

Review the purpose of the phase and its tasks to determine the testing goals. 

Plan and Execute Tests:  

Break tasks down into detailed test cases and implement them systematically. 

Validate and Debug:  

Check the correctness of all tests and debug any issues that arise. 

Analyze Coverage:  

Ensure sufficient coverage for all critical paths and features outlined in the roadmap. 

Prepare Reports:  

Summarize the results of the phase, highlighting successes, failures, and uncovered areas. 

 

 

Types of Tests 

Implement the following test types as part of the plan: 

Unit Tests:  

Focus on individual functions and modules for correctness and edge cases. 

Integration Tests:  

Validate the interaction between components, ensuring seamless workflows. 

Regression Tests:  

Prevent reintroduction of previously fixed bugs by verifying historical issues. 

Performance Tests:  

Benchmark critical metrics like speed, memory usage, and efficiency. 

Fault Tolerance Tests:  

Simulate errors, missing dependencies, and corrupted data to test system resilience. 

Usability Tests (if applicable):  

Validate the usability of any CLI/GUI interfaces and user workflows. 

 

 

Deliverables 

At the end of the testing process, you should provide: 

A comprehensive suite of automated and manual tests. 

Test scripts and configurations for all tools and frameworks. 

Clear documentation of test results, including coverage metrics, failure analysis, and regressions. 

CI pipeline integration for automated test execution. 

Recommendations for improving test coverage and addressing uncovered areas. 

 

 

Maintenance 

Update Tests:  

Add new tests for features or bug fixes and remove obsolete ones. 

Review Coverage:  

Periodically assess the effectiveness of tests and improve coverage where needed. 

Track Effectiveness:  

Monitor test performance and continuously enhance automation and reporting. 

 

Make sure to examine output of tests in terminal or log folder, create logs folder if needed for testing purposes  

 

Update .gitignore as needed.
