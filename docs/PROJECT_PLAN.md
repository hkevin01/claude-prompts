# Claude Prompts Collection - Project Plan

## Project Overview

The Claude Prompts Collection is a curated repository of high-quality prompts designed for use with Claude AI. The project provides a structured, searchable, and well-documented collection of prompts across multiple categories including coding, creative writing, business communications, data analysis, education, and personal productivity.

**Target Audience:** Developers, content creators, business professionals, educators, and anyone who uses Claude AI regularly and wants to leverage proven, effective prompts.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown-based documentation, structured templates, automated cataloging system, modern development tooling and configuration.

## Phase 1: Project Structure Analysis & Planning
- [x] ✅ Analyze existing project structure and content
- [x] ✅ Identify project type and purpose (AI prompt collection)
- [x] ✅ Document current assets and organization system
- [x] ✅ Plan modern directory restructure with src layout
- [x] ✅ Design comprehensive documentation strategy

**Analysis Results:**
- Current structure has basic organization with prompts/, templates/, examples/, utils/, docs/
- Contains 4 example prompts across different categories 
- Uses YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Has basic catalog system in CATALOG.md
- Needs modernization for better maintainability and collaboration

## Phase 2: Modern Directory Structure Implementation ✅
- [x] 📁 Create src/ directory as primary source structure
- [x] 📁 Reorganize prompts into src/prompts/ with enhanced categorization (33+ prompts organized)
- [x] 📁 Move templates to src/templates/ with validation schemas
- [x] 📁 Create data/ directory for JSON catalogs and metadata
- [x] 📁 Establish assets/ directory for images, examples, and media

**Directory Layout (Implemented):**
```
src/
├── prompts/           # 33+ organized prompt collections
│   ├── coding/       # 25+ coding prompts
│   ├── creative/     # 3+ creative prompts
│   ├── business/     # 2+ business prompts
│   ├── analysis/     # Data analysis prompts
│   ├── educational/  # Learning resources
│   └── personal/     # Productivity prompts
├── templates/         # Prompt templates and schemas
├── schemas/          # JSON/YAML validation schemas

│   ├── promptManager.ts
│   ├── promptsProvider.ts
│   ├── promptSearchProvider.ts
│   └── types.ts
└── utils/            # Helper utilities and scripts
```
